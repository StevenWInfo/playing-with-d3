#playing-with-d3

A little visualization I made while I was playing around with D3 a while ago that I haven't got around to uploading until now. Makes an interactive graph of how many biopics have been released in film history. I found the data [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/biopics) while looking through random datasets. I'd like to reimplement it using Purescript and it's d3 library, but I don't know when I'll get to that.
