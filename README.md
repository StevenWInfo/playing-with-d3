#playing-with-d3

A little visualization I made while I was playing around with D3 a while ago that I haven't got around to uploading until now. It's an interactive graph of how many biopics have been released in film history, which you can view [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/StevenWInfo/playing-with-d3/blob/master/index.html) using github's html previewer. Most of what I used was learned from various sources such as the online book for *[Interactive Data Visualizations](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/)*. I found the data [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/biopics) while looking through random datasets. I'd like to reimplement it using Purescript and it's D3 library, but I don't know when I'll get to that.
